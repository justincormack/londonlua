<h1>Special January meeting with Roberto Ierusalimschy</h1>

<p>In January Roberto the founder of Lua visited us and we had a packed meetup with two talks and a Q&A. Videos now available at <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/london-lua-feat-luas-creator-roberto-ierusalimschy">online at Skills Matter</a>

<h2>Adapting Lua to an old OS - a case study, by Gavin Wraith</h2>

<p>AndroLua is a demonstration project by Michal Kottman which bundles
Lua 5.1 and LuaJava as an application you can run on your phone or an
emulator.  The version I will demonstrate implements a simple TCP
server so that one can open an interactive session on a host machine.
Only weighing in at 260Kb, AndroLua provides access to most Android
APIs directly through Java reflection.  It is a good way to learn the
capabilities of this OS without a time-consuming compile-upload-launch
cycle, and Lua modules and other assets can be uploaded to a running
program. I will show how the dynamic nature of Lua and its support for
first-class functions makes Android application development more
pleasant and productive.

<p>The designers of the ARM architecture designed RISC OS to
go with it. The economic constraints of the time implied a number
of compromises and constraints. It was designed in Cambridge in a
culture of BCPL rather than C. The philosophies behind RISC OS and Lua
clash on a number of issues. This brief talk points out the problems
of marrying the two, and how the flexibility of Lua makes that possible.

<p>Gavin Wraith studied Classics at Winchester College in 50s, and went on to study Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge and Courant Institute, before becoming Reader in Mathematics at Sussex University, and Toposes at Matematisk Institut in Aarhus. He was infected with microcomputing by the Acorn Atom, and fell in love with Lua in 2002.

<h3>Using LLVM to generate Lua bindings by Justin Cormack</h3>

<p>LLVM is a new(ish) open source compiler suite developed by Apple and others. It provides libraries which can be used, among other things, to analyse C code and easily generate bindings for C and C++ code to Lua without too much tedious manual work.

<p>Justin Cormack is a London-based developer, systems person and consultant who enjoys performance optimisation on large and small systems. He organises the London Lua meetup.

<h3>Lua Q&A with Roberto Ierusalimschy, creator of Lua</h3>

<p>Back in 1993 Roberto created Lua in Rio, and has remained its benevolent dictator. Come and ask any questions about its past, present and future.

<p>Roberto Ierusalimschy (born 1960) is an associate professor of informatics at PUC-Rio (Pontifical University in Rio de Janeiro). He is the leading architect of the Lua programming language and the author of Programming in Lua, and is also responsible for introducing Parsing Expression Grammars as a formalism over ad-hoc regular expression structures.
