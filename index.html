<h1>London Lua</h1>

<p>London Lua is a user group for all aspects of the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua programming language</a>.
<p>Meetings will take place monthly at <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> in <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/go/find-us">Clerkenwell, London</a>.

<p>Meetings are on the first Thursday of the month. The next meeting is 6 December 2012 at 18:30.

<h2>Developing a Lua VM in JavaScript by Paul Cuthbertson</h2>

<p>Paul is a front-end web developer at Gamesys, one of the UKâ€™s largest online gaming companies, on their multi-platform development team. From a software engineering background, he now spends most of his time in the browser, coding JavaScript. Outside of work Paul is helping found a Hackspace in Hitchin and can talk for hours about Formula One.

<p>Paul will talk you through the development of a Lua virtual machine in JavaScript which enables Lua to be executed, and even debugged, in the browser. This is a small but integral part of Gamesys's "write once, deploy everywhere" strategy, which involves writing entire games in Lua.
