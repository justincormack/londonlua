<h2>Using Lua for the Internet of Things with Eclipse Koneki and Mihini by Benjamin Cabé</h2>

<p>Please <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/using-lua-for-the-internet-of-things-with-eclipse-koneki-and-mihini">signup at Skills Matter</a>.

<p>In this presentation you'll have an overview of Eclipse open-source projects Koneki and Mihini that provide a complete IDE for Lua (remote development, debugging, advanced content-assist, ...) as well as an embedded application framework (I/Os abstraction, communication with the wireless modem, M2M data consolidation and efficient transmission over the air, …) for building Internet of Things applications.

<p>There will be a live demo not only of the open-source software stack (Koneki and Mihini), but also showcasing Open Source hardware – Raspberry Pi and Arduino FTW!

<p>Benjamin is Open Source Evangelist at Sierra Wireless. He has a longtime passion for Eclipse and its ecosystem, and is a committer on several Eclipse projects (e4, PDE, …) and contributor to numerous other open source projects. In his day-to-day job, and as the chair person of the Eclipse M2M Industry Working Group, he advocates the use of innovative technologies for the Internet of Things. He also co-leads Eclipse projects Koneki and Mihini.

<p>When not wandering on the Internets engaging M2M/IoT developers, he is building crazy machines with Arduino kits and Raspberry Pis! You can find him online on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/kartben">@kartben</a>) or <a href="http://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/">on his blog</a>.
