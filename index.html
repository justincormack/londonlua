<h1>London Lua</h1>

<p>London Lua is a user group for all aspects of the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua programming language</a>.
<p>Meetings will take place monthly at <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> in <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/go/find-us">Clerkenwell, London</a>.

<p>The next meeting is 22 January 2013 at 18:30.

<h2>Special January meeting with Roberto Ierusalimschy</h2>

<p>Roberto Ierusalimschy, the developer of Lua is going to be in London for our next meetup. We will have a couple of short talks and a Q&A with Roberto. 


<p>The creator of Lua, Roberto Ierusalimschy, is going to be visiting London this month, so we are having a special meetup in his honour!

<p>We are going to have two short talks, plus a Q&A about Lua with Roberto.

<p>We will be giving away a (signed!) copy of the newly released edition of Programming in Lua, hot off the press.

<p>Please <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/london-lua-feat-luas-creator-roberto-ierusalimschy">sign up here</a>.

<h3>Adapting Lua to an old OS - a case study, by Gavin Wraith</h3>

<p>The designers of the ARM architecture designed RISC OS to
go with it. The economic constraints of the time implied a number
of compromises and constraints. It was designed in Cambridge in a
culture of BCPL rather than C. The philosophies behind RISC OS and Lua
clash on a number of issues. This brief talk points out the problems
of marrying the two, and how the flexibility of Lua makes that possible.

<p>Gavin Wraith studied Classics at Winchester College in 50s, and went on to study Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge and Courant Institute, before becoming Reader in Mathematics at Sussex University, and Toposes at Matematisk Institut in Aarhus. He was infected with microcomputing by the Acorn Atom, and fell in love with Lua in 2002.

<h3>Using LLVM to generate Lua bindings by Justin Cormack</h3>

<p>LLVM is a new(ish) open source compiler suite developed by Apple and others. It provides libraries which can be used, among other things, to analyse C code and easily generate bindings for C and C++ code to Lua without too much tedious manual work.

<p>Justin Cormack is a London-based developer, systems person and consultant who enjoys performance optimisation on large and small systems. He organises the London Lua meetup.

<h3>Lua Q&A with Roberto Ierusalimschy, creator of Lua</h3>

<p>Back in 1993 Roberto created Lua in Rio, and has remained its benevolent dictator. Come and ask any questions about its past, present and future.

<p>Roberto Ierusalimschy (born 1960) is an associate professor of informatics at PUC-Rio (Pontifical University in Rio de Janeiro). He is the leading architect of the Lua programming language and the author of Programming in Lua, and is also responsible for introducing Parsing Expression Grammars as a formalism over ad-hoc regular expression structures.
