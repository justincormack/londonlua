<h1>London Lua</h1>

<p>London Lua is a user group for all aspects of the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua programming language</a>.
<p>Meetings will take place monthly at <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> in <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/go/find-us">Clerkenwell, London</a>.

<p>Meetings are on the first Thursday of the month. The next meeting is 6 December 2012 at 18:30, details to be announced shortly.

<h2>Luawrap - wrapping lua scripts into self executing files by David Whale</h2>

<p>luawrap started off as an idea without a language back in 2006, when David
wanted to settle on a single language for scripting purposes, with a way of
turning scripts into executables that can be given to customers (so they
can use, but not steal all his neat ideas).

<p>Almost on the verge of writing his own language, a friend introduced him to
lua. But the "self executing script" idea still stood as a strong requirement,
and he developed some simple elegant techniques.

<p>luawrap allows lua programmers to wrap their lua scripts into standalone 
executables with no external system dependencies, without needing to install 
or use any special tools, whilst providing the option to hide the intellectual
property embedded inside the executable.

<p>This talk looks at some of the challenges involved, and some of the neat things
you can do with self executing lua scripts.

<h2>David Whale</h2>

<p>David Whale runs a small software consultancy, mainly developing
embedded firmware for neat gadgets. His claim to fame was being part of the
development team for the GSM MODEM used inside the very first Blackberry devices, and was probably the first person to walk into a lamp-post texting on one.

<p>As part of his day job, he finds himself regularly writing little lua scripts
to automate code generation, testing, post-mortem log analysis, web statistics
analysis and website generation, amongst other things.

<p>David has been using lua for the last 6 years, recently delving deep into the
C sources and making it jump through a few more hoops.

<p>He lives in Essex, and is trying to cultivate a nomadic lifestyle roaming
between coffee shops and libraries, where all he needs is a laptop, a mobile 
phone, and a lua interpreter to get his job done.
