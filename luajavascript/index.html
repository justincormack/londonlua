<h1>Developing a Lua VM in Javascript by Paul Cuthbertson</h1>

<p>Paul is a front-end web developer at Gamesys, one of the UKâ€™s largest online gaming companies, on their multi-platform development team. From a software engineering background, he now spends most of his time in the browser, coding JavaScript. Outside of work Paul is helping found a Hackspace in Hitchin and can talk for hours about Formula One.

<p>Paul talked through the development of a Lua virtual machine in JavaScript which enables Lua to be executed, and even debugged, in the browser. This is a small but integral part of Gamesys's "write once, deploy everywhere" strategy, which involves writing entire games in Lua.
