<h2>Lua with Android using AndroLua by Steve Donovan</h2>

<p>AndroLua is a demonstration project by Michal Kottman which bundles
Lua 5.1 and LuaJava as an application you can run on your phone or an
emulator.  The version I will demonstrate implements a simple TCP
server so that one can open an interactive session on a host machine.
Only weighing in at 260Kb, AndroLua provides access to most Android
APIs directly through Java reflection.  It is a good way to learn the
capabilities of this OS without a time-consuming compile-upload-launch
cycle, and Lua modules and other assets can be uploaded to a running
program. I will show how the dynamic nature of Lua and its support for
first-class functions makes Android application development more
pleasant and productive.

<p>Steve Donovan works at CSIR Mining Innovation laboratories, Johannesburg, South
Africa.  He has been active in open-source Lua development, and is a
<a href="https://github.com/stevedonovan">compulsive creator of Github repositories</a>.
